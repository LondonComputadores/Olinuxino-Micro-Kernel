    anyhow so I'm going to spend a little time with it now that
    the 0-day NMU is ok...

    that's 255 chars for the password) (Closes: #122800, #122802)
    - Added debmake to Build-Depends (Closes: #190609)
    - Added GPL note to debian/copyright (Closes: #133506) 
    - Added more documentation on README.Debian which specifically 
    says that ttysnoop must run as root if going through inetd
    (Closes: #97719)
    - Fixed some lintians errors/warnings including the old emacs
    note in debian/changelog and adding the '-isp' option to
    dpkg-gencontrol to add Section and Priority information to the
    control file.
