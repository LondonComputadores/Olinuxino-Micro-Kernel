  GNU/kFreeBSD now has working code, after a slight
  alteration to the old patch for UNIX98 PTY support.

ttysnoop (0.12d-4) unstable; urgency=low

  Both executables "ttysnoops" and "ttysnoop" have been modified
  to require enhanced user privileges in order to be usable!
  Snooping on others should not be possible by the common man.
