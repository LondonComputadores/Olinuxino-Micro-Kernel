README for ttysnoop 0.12d (alpha) -- 08-04-98

This is version 0.12 of ttysnoop for Linux. It introduces one new feature 
and now also has support for shadow passwords. (Thanx to those who mailed 
me the patches)

The package allows you to snoop on login tty's through another tty-device 
or pseudo-tty. The snoop-tty becomes a 'clone' of the original tty, 
redirecting both input and output from/to it.

To install, untar the archive, customize Makefile and config.h and type 
'make'. If all goes well, type 'make install' next and copy the example 
snooptab.dist file to /etc/snooptab. Edit this new copy and tell your 
getty/telnetd to execute /sbin/ttysnoops as the login program (instead of 
/bin/login). You should then be able to snoop upon the tty's listed in 
/etc/snooptab whevener a user logs in on them.

Mail any bug-reports/patches/comments to carl@miskatonic.inbe.net (preferred)
or carl@miskatonic.nfe.be.


History log:

* From v0.11 onwards, user authentication is performed via a password prompt
  whenever snooping is done through a pty.

* From v0.12 onwards, the ttysnoop client supports a suspend/resume key
  (default ctrl-\) which suspends/resumes snooping when it is pressed. Might
  come in handy when snooping rz/sz sessions. ;)

* Version 0.12c is a bugfix release for 0.12. It mainly addresses the
  lingering utmp-entries bug that caused users to "remain online" when
  doing a 'w' or 'who' command. Apart from a few other minor cleanups,
  this version is identical to v0.12.

* Version 0.12d is a few cleanups/updates in the #includes department so
  that it compiles OK again on newer systems such as RH5. Also check the 
  LIBS= value in Makefile if you're still on a system without libcrypt.
